# Diabetes Prediction

## Executive Summary

This project involves predicting diabetes progression based on various health indicators using a linear regression model. The dataset contains medical data related to diabetes, including metrics such as age, BMI, and blood pressure. The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the progression of diabetes over time based on these features.

## Problem

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prediction of diabetes progression are crucial for effective treatment and management. In this project, we aim to predict the progression of diabetes using a set of health features, helping healthcare professionals and patients to better manage the condition.

## Methodology

1. **Data Import and Exploration**
   - Use the `load_diabetes` dataset from the scikit-learn library.
   - Create a pandas DataFrame to explore the dataset, including its structure and statistical summaries.
   - Perform data cleaning by checking for missing values and understanding data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generate a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between features.
   - Use box plots to detect outliers and understand feature distributions.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Prepare the data for model training by selecting appropriate features.

4. **Model Building**
   - Train a linear regression model using the training dataset.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compare predicted values with actual values to assess the model's accuracy.
   - Visualize the results using scatter plots and regression lines.

## Skills

- **Data Analysis**: Proficiency in analyzing and visualizing medical data using pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Knowledge of linear regression and performance evaluation metrics.
- **Machine Learning**: Experience in training and testing predictive models.
- **Python Programming**: Strong skills in Python for data manipulation and modeling.
